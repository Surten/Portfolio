Unity project
I worked in a team project aiming to make a vr simulator/escape room from a space station.
The player is first supposed to perform various tasks.
My main work on this project was making the screens here and the functionality behind them-
Then also working with and connecting screen functionalities to state machines responsible for the tasks.
